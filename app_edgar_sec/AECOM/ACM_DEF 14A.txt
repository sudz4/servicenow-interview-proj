 Leading by example:Advising on the energy transitionWith our own industry-leading sustainability journey to guide us,we're helping organizations protect the environment, enhancecommunities, integrate sustainable development into everydaybusiness, and improve governance.These ambitions look different for every organization and industry,so we help clients understand where they are in the energy transitioncontinuum and then develop a tailored roadmap with tangible nextsteps so they can build momentum to achieve their goals.We're advancing our leading advisory position by partneringwith clients to navigate and accelerate their energy transition.Our flagship global thought leadership report, The Future ofInfrastructure, Lost in Transition? is driving these conversations.Based on qualitative and quantitative research carried out withnearly 850 senior executives spanning nine industries and 22countries, it provides our clients and the broader industry withpractical, profitable, predictable, and people-centric strategies toachieve net zero.COP28As the sustainability consultant for the 28th UNFCC Conferenceof Parties (COP28) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), we played apivotal role in shaping a leading sustainability and environmentalmanagement strategy, guiding the event toward carbonneutrality. Our comprehensive approach established frameworks,management guidelines, and carbon management plans, integratingsustainability processes and carbon-tracking tools into the event.Our role extended beyond COP28 itself, creating the foundation forsustainable operations in future COPs and elevating sustainabilitystandards within the UAE’s event sector.Leveraging our UAE-based environmental consultants and globalnetwork of experts, we provided advisory services to attain ISO20121 certification for sustainable events and supported theimplementation of operational sustainability throughout the event’ssupply chain. Following the event, there’s a tremendous amount ofwork to do to move us from ambition to action. Initiatives like thenear-zero emissions building breakthrough highlight the value ofCOP28, but also that we must now take steps to operationalize.With our technical expertise, knowledge of the increasinglymultifaceted energy infrastructure landscape, plus implementationexperience of new and coming technologies, AECOM is wellpositioned to advise on and help drive this transformative change.Powering New York with offshore windIn line with our client, Equinor’s commitment to cleaner energy forNew York, the Beacon Wind project was carefully crafted with astrategic approach. Our role centers on environmental permittingand engineering for the offshore lease area, covering 128,000acres south of Nantucket, MA. This area is integral to Equinor’sportfolio, including Empire Wind 1, Empire Wind 2, and BeaconWind 1, collectively aiming to provide 3.3 gigawatts of electricityto New York.Community engagement is vital, involving Indigenous nations,stakeholders, and local fishing communities to assess and minimizethe project’s impact on the local economy. Working closely withthe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), we are obtainingapprovals for the site assessment plan (SAP) and conductingessential surveys and studies.Our team conducts in-depth research to design alternativesubmarine cable routing options, considering cost, schedule, andenvironmental factors.

         Executive Compensation Practices    Our executive compensation program provides competitive packages that attract, motivate, reward and retain key talent critical to achieving long-term financial and strategic objectives, meeting our ongoing commitment to sustainability, diversity, and inclusion, and creating long-term stockholder value.    What We Do:   
​ | ✔ Pay for Performance — We condition a majority of the compensation opportunity for our NEOs on the achievement of key measures of value creation, including Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), adjusted earnings per share growth, free cash flow, Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”) improvement, and Relative Total Stockholder Return (“TSR”). ​ | ​
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--
​ | ✔ Rigorous Goal Setting — We undergo a detailed process of analyzing and reviewing a number of factors including, but not limited to our short and long-term financial plan; investor expectations; industry and peer performance; industry benchmarking; overall achievability; and stockholder value creation. ​ | ​
​ | ✔ Stockholder Engagement — We engage with stockholders throughout the year on proxy and governance matters, including direct outreach to stockholders that represent the ownership of more than 50% of our stock. ​ | ​
​ | ✔ Stock Ownership Guidelines — We have stock ownership guidelines that require NEOs to maintain a significant equity stake in the Company to align the interests of management with stockholders. The CEO ownership guideline is six times the base salary and the guideline for other NEOs is three times base salary. ​ | ​
​ | ✔ Independent Consultant — We utilize the services of an independent compensation consultant who does not provide any other services to the Company. ​ | ​
​ | ✔ Clawback Policy — We updated our clawback policy in compliance with Rule 10D-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and NYSE Listing Standards, which requires us to recoup erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation paid to current and former officers in connection with an accounting restatement. ​ | ​
​ | ✔ Risk Assessment — Our compensation consultant performs an independent risk assessment of compensation programs. ​ | ​
​ | ✔ Competitive Analysis — We annually seek to understand labor market trends pertaining to amount and form of executive pay delivery through comprehensive competitive analyses. ​ | ​
​ | ✔ Annual Say-on-Pay Vote — We have a policy to hold an advisory vote to approve the Company’s executive compensation on an annual basis. ​ | ​

  What We Don’t Do:   
​ | ✘ Dividends and Dividend Equivalents on Unvested Awards — Our stock plan prohibits the payout of dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested long-term incentive equity awards unless and until the underlying award vests. ​ | ​
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--
​ | ✘ Stock Option Repricing — Our stock plan prohibits re-pricing underwater stock options or stock appreciation rights without stockholder approval. ​ | ​
​ | ✘ Single Trigger Equity Acceleration — We do not maintain plans or agreements that provide for automatic “single trigger” equity acceleration or bonus payments in connection with a change in control (rather, any payment of benefit requires a qualifying termination of employment in connection with a change in control known as “double trigger”). ​ | ​
​ | ✘ Tax Gross-Ups — We do not provide tax gross-ups to NEOs. ​ | ​
​ | ✘ Hedging and Pledging — We prohibit hedging transactions involving AECOM common stock and do not allow trading in puts, calls, options or other similar transactions. In addition, we prohibit the pledging of AECOM common stock except in certain limited circumstances subject to Company approval and demonstration of the ability to repay the applicable loan without selling such securities. ​ | ​

         Environmental, Social and Governance Matters   
 We are a leader in environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and corporate governance, both within our operations and through our technical work for clients. We embrace sustainability by striving to make a positive, lasting impact on society and the environment. We have both a significant opportunity and a responsibility to protect, enhance and restore the world’s natural and social systems.    We are committed to addressing the effects of climate change as a key priority for our sustainability program, including by advancing ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. To this point, in fiscal 2022, we were among the first companies globally to have set net zero emissions reduction targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), which are designed to exceed the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change and align with a 1.5-degrees warming scenario. These net zero emissions reduction goals include a near-term target to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 50% by 2030 and a long-term target to reduce total emissions by 90% by 2040. Importantly, we have made strong progress on these targets already, with Scope 1 and 2 emissions declining by 61% in fiscal 2023 as compared to our fiscal 2018 baseline, contributing to a total emissions reduction of 23% as compared to our baseline year. Our emissions reduction ambitions build upon our commitments as a signatory to the UN Global Compact.    In addition, we continue to invest in proprietary innovations and digital solutions to positively impact the planet, such as our AI-enabled flood modeling tool that is more than 300% faster than traditional methods and significantly more accurate. We have also developed our proprietary DE-FLUOROTM water treatment solution to destroy per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on-site. Across our water practice, our services have contributed to water and wastewater treatment centers that combined treat more than 18 billion gallons of water, reaching more than 150 million people, every day. We are also leading on decarbonization measurement, biodiversity impact and re-wilding, such as through our innovative work at the National Capital Laboratory (NCL) in the U.K., where we are restoring 100 acres of forest and reintroducing lost species. Our work at the NCL won the 2022 Verdantix Innovation Excellence Award for Sustainability Strategy Implementation for success in analyzing and measuring biodiversity impact, underscoring the significant positive impact we can have on nature and biodiversity.    Driving ESG Across Our Operations    We maintain an enterprise-wide Global ESG Council to coordinate and drive consistent execution of our environmental, social and corporate governance (“ESG”) initiatives across AECOM. The Council’s functions include: (i) assessing the impact of the Company’s services and operations and advising on how the Company may enhance its ESG performance; (ii) advising on appropriate global ESG goals, commitments and targets; (iii) advising on suitable resourcing and investments to fulfill and deliver on the Company’s ESG commitments; (iv) shaping the Company’s ESG policies and disclosure; (v) assessing the potential impact of climate change on the Company’s services and operations and providing a global forum to share ideas on how the Company’s unique offerings and 
        

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
         solutions can enable mitigation, adaptation and resilience to climate change that will develop and support buildings, infrastructure assets and communities; and (vi) providing a risk framework for evaluating client opportunities to ensure that they align with our ESG objectives. The Council is composed of employees with relevant professional expertise and experience including strategic and market sector leadership; consulting expertise; operations; procurement, legal, investor relations, treasury, real estate and facilities management and other corporate functions. Our Board has oversight over ESG matters. Additional information regarding our ESG initiatives is located on the investor relations section of our website, at https://investors.aecom.com/esg.    Commitment to Our People (Human Capital Management)    Our principal asset is our employees, the majority of which have technical and professional backgrounds and undergraduate and/or advanced degrees in their respective areas of expertise. At the end of our fiscal 2023, we employed approximately 52,000 persons. We believe that the quality and level of service that our professionals deliver are among the highest in our industry.    We are committed to enhancing our position as a leading employer in our industry by attracting and retaining some of the best technical professionals in the world. Critical to our continued success is our ability to offer a compelling employee value proposition that promises competitive pay and benefits, an inclusive environment that supports flexibility and well-being and encourages collaboration and innovation, and a shared commitment to technical excellence, continuous learning and career growth. This understanding informs our approach to managing our human capital resources. Our human capital objectives and initiatives are overseen by our Board as per our Corporate Governance Guidelines.    Additional information on our human capital management initiatives can be found on pages v to xvii of this document.

         Annual Meeting Information    ​

 Proxies    ​

 You may vote your shares at the 2024 Annual Meeting or by proxy if you are a record holder. There are three ways to vote by proxy: (1) on the Internet by following the instructions on the Notice or proxy card, (2) by telephone by calling 1-800-652-8683 and following the instructions on the Notice or proxy card or (3) by requesting a printed copy of the proxy materials and signing, dating and mailing the enclosed proxy card to the address accompanying your proxy materials. If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or another holder of record, you will receive instructions from the holder of record. You must follow the instructions of the holder of record in order for your shares to be voted. Internet and telephone voting will also be offered to stockholders owning shares through certain banks and brokers.    You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the 2024 Annual Meeting by (1) giving our Corporate Secretary written notice of revocation, (2) delivering to us a signed proxy card with a later date, (3) granting a subsequent proxy through the Internet or telephone or (4) attending the 2024 Annual Meeting and voting. Written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to the revocation of proxies should be addressed to AECOM, 13355 Noel Road, Suite 400, Dallas, Texas 75240, Attention: Corporate Secretary.    All shares represented by valid proxies received and not revoked before they are exercised will be voted in the manner specified in the proxy. Other than with respect to certain trustees who hold our shares in trust, if you submit proxy voting instructions but do not direct how to vote on each item, the persons named as proxies will vote in favor of each of the proposals. Our Board is unaware of any matters other than those described in this Proxy Statement that may be presented for action at our 2024 Annual Meeting. If other matters do properly come before our 2024 Annual Meeting, however, it is intended that shares represented by proxies will be voted in the discretion of the proxy holders.    If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares in the name of a bank, broker or another holder of record and do not return the voting instruction card, the broker or another nominee may vote your shares on each matter at the 2024 Annual Meeting for which he or she has the requisite discretionary authority. Under applicable rules, brokers have the discretion to vote on routine matters, which include the ratification of the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm. Brokers will not have the discretion to vote on any of the other proposals presented at the 2024 Annual Meeting.    ​

 Solicitation of Proxies    ​

 We will pay the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail and by the Internet, we will request banks, brokers and other record holders to send proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of our common stock and to secure their voting instructions, if necessary. We will reimburse record holders for their reasonable expenses in performing these tasks. We have agreed to pay Georgeson LLC $15,000 plus reasonable expenses, costs and disbursements for various proxy solicitation services associated with the 2024 Annual Meeting. If necessary, we may use our regular employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies from stockholders, whether personally or by telephone, letter or other means.

 Record Date and Voting Rights    ​

 Our Board has fixed January 19, 2024 as the record date for determining the stockholders who are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, our 2024 Annual Meeting. Only common stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date will receive notice of, and be able to vote at, our 2024 Annual Meeting. As of the record date, there were 136,023,419 shares of our common stock outstanding held by 1,471 record holders. A majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote must be present at our 2024 Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy, in order for there to be a quorum at the meeting. Each share of our outstanding common stock entitles its holder to one vote. Shares of our common stock with respect to which the holders are present at our 2024 Annual Meeting but not voting, and shares for which we have received proxies but with respect to which holders of the shares have abstained, will be counted as present at our 2024 Annual Meeting for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists. “Broker non-votes” will also be counted as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists. Broker non-votes are shares of common stock held by brokers or nominees over which the broker or nominee lacks discretionary power to vote and for which the broker or nominee has not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner.    Our Board urges you to vote promptly by (1) electronically submitting a proxy or voting instruction card over the Internet, (2) by telephone or (3) by delivering to us or to your broker, as applicable, a signed and dated proxy card.    Votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the 2024 Annual Meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes.    ​

 Year End Reporting Convention    ​

 We report our results of operations based on 52- or 53-week periods ending on the Friday nearest September 30. For clarity of presentation, all periods are presented as if the fiscal year ended on September 30. Fiscal 2023 consisted of a 52-week period.    ​

 Majority Voting; Director Resignation Policy    ​

 In uncontested elections, directors will be elected by a majority of the votes cast, which means that the number of shares voted “for” a director must exceed the number of shares voted “against” that director. In uncontested elections, any director who is not elected by a majority of the votes is expected to tender his or her resignation to the Nominating and Governance Committee (“Nominating Committee”). The Nominating Committee will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation offer, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating Committee’s recommendation within 90 days following certification of the election results.
        

  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
         Proposal 1 Election of Directors
 We are nominating 9 directors for election to our Board, all of whom are current members of our Board that are standing for re-election at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Directors elected at the 2024 Annual Meeting will serve until the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. If a quorum is present at our 2024 Annual Meeting, the directors will be elected by a majority of the votes cast, which means that the number of shares voted “for” a director must exceed the number of shares voted “against” that director, with any director who is not elected by a majority of the votes cast being expected to tender his or her resignation to the Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation offer, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating Committee’s recommendation within 90 days following certification of the election results.    Shares represented by proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of each of the director nominees named in this Proxy Statement. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. Each of the nominees has consented to serve as a director if elected, and management has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected as a director, except as set forth in the remainder of this paragraph. In the event that any nominee is unavailable for re-election as a result of an unexpected occurrence, shares will be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as our Board may propose. 
 ​

 Director Qualifications    ​

 The Board believes that its members should collectively possess a combination of the skills, professional experience and diversity of backgrounds necessary to oversee the Company’s business. The Nominating Committee is responsible for developing and recommending Board membership criteria to the full Board for approval. The criteria, which are set forth in the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, include the highest professional and personal ethics and values, commitment to enhancing stockholder value with sufficient time to effectively carry out his or her duties and business acumen. In considering director candidates, the Nominating Committee looks for business experience and skills, judgment, integrity, an understanding of such areas as finance, marketing, regulation and public policy and the absence of potential conflicts with the Company’s interests. In particular, the Nominating Committee seeks candidates that have skills/experience in the following areas, each of which it is views as particularly important: senior leadership experience, industry experience, public company experience, financial expertise, government/regulatory expertise and international expertise. The Nominating Committee believes that it is essential that Board members represent diverse viewpoints and backgrounds.    The Nominating Committee periodically reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the current composition of the Board, the operating requirements of the Company and the long-term interests of the Company’s stockholders. In conducting this assessment, the Nominating Committee considers diversity, skills and such other factors as it deems appropriate to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capabilities. This periodic assessment enables the Board to update the skills and experience it seeks in the Board, as a whole and in individual directors, as the Company’s needs evolve over time and to assess the effectiveness of efforts at pursuing diversity. From time to time, while identifying director candidates, the Nominating Committee may establish specific skills and experience that it believes the Company should seek to constitute a balanced and effective Board.    Further, the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board should be comprised of individuals with diverse backgrounds and perspectives and should include representation of individuals from underrepresented communities, including people of different genders, experiences, ages, races and ethnic backgrounds.

 Vote Required and Recommendation of the Board of Directors    ​

 Directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast for and against by holders of shares entitled to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting. This means that for each director the number of votes cast “FOR” the director must exceed the number of votes cast “AGAINST” the director. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be considered votes cast.   
​ | ​ | The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the election of each nominee for director. | ​ | ​

         Proposal 2 Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 The Audit Committee of our Board has retained Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024. Ernst & Young LLP has served as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm since 1990. A representative of Ernst & Young LLP is expected to be present at the 2024 Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if the representative so desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.    ​

 Reasons for the Proposal    ​

 The selection of our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to be submitted for stockholder approval, but the Audit Committee of our Board is seeking ratification of its selection of Ernst & Young LLP from our stockholders as a matter of good corporate practice. If stockholders do not ratify this selection, the Audit Committee of our Board will reconsider its selection of Ernst & Young LLP and will, in its sole discretion, either continue to retain this firm or appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in the Company’s best interests and the best interests of our stockholders.    ​

 Reasons for Recommendation to Appoint Ernst & Young as the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    ​

 As with previous years, the Audit Committee undertook a review of Ernst & Young LLP in determining whether to select Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024 and to recommend ratification of its selection to the Company’s stockholders. In that review, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors including:    •
  continued independence of Ernst & Young LLP;   ​
  •
  length of time Ernst & Young LLP has been engaged by the Company;   ​
  •
  senior management’s assessment of Ernst & Young LLP’s performance;   ​
  •
  audit and non-audit fees;   ​
  •
  capacity to appropriately staff the audit;   ​
  •
  geographic and subject matter coverage;   ​
  •
  lead audit engagement partner performance;   ​
  •
  overall performance;   ​
  •
  qualifications and quality control procedures; and   ​
  •
  whether retaining Ernst & Young LLP is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.   ​
  Based upon this review, the Audit Committee believes that Ernst & Young LLP is independent and that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to retain Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2024.    In accordance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act and the related SEC rules, the Audit Committee limits the number of consecutive years an individual partner may serve as the lead audit engagement partner to the Company. The maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The current lead audit engagement partner is in his third year in that role.

 Vote Required and Recommendation of the Board of Directors    ​

 The ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal at the 2024 Annual Meeting. Abstentions will be counted as present and will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. Brokers have discretion to vote on the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm and, as such, no votes on this proposal will be considered broker non-votes.

         Proposal 3 Advisory Resolution to ApproveExecutive Compensation
 In accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), we are asking our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, AECOM’s executive compensation as reported in this Proxy Statement.    At AECOM, executive compensation plans are driven by both short- and long-term financial performance metrics that are designed to incentivize our Named Executive Officers (NEOs) to maximize long-term stockholder value creation. As such, based on direct stockholder feedback, AECOM’s executives are incentivized via an annual cash bonus plan and the grant of certain long-term equity awards that include without limitation the following performance metrics: adjusted earnings per share, return on invested capital, and relative total stockholder return.    We urge stockholders to read the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section in this Proxy Statement, which describes in more detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives, as well as the “Summary Compensation Table” and related compensation tables and narrative, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our NEOs. The Compensation and Organization Committee (“Compensation Committee”) and the Board believe that the policies, procedures and programs articulated in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” are effective in achieving our goals and that the compensation of our NEOs reported in this Proxy Statement has supported and contributed to the Company’s success.    We are asking stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the 2024 Annual Meeting:    RESOLVED, that the stockholders of AECOM approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s Named Executive Officers, disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, set forth in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the related compensation tables and narrative in the Proxy Statement for the Company’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.    This advisory resolution, commonly referred to as a “Say-on-Pay” resolution, is nonbinding on the Company, the Board and the Compensation Committee and will not be construed as overruling a decision by, nor creating nor implying any additional fiduciary duty for the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results on this proposal when evaluating our executive compensation program.    ​

 Vote Required and Recommendation of the Board of Directors    ​

 The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the 2024 Annual Meeting is required to approve the advisory resolution on the Company’s executive compensation. Abstentions will be counted as present and will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted as participating in the voting on the proposal and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal.   
​ | ​ | The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the advisory resolution to approve executive compensation. | ​ | ​

 Board Meetings    ​

 During our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, our Board met four times, the Audit Committee met four times, the Compensation Committee met three times and the Nominating Committee met four times. Each incumbent director attended more than 75% of the aggregate of (1) the total number of meetings of our Board and (2) the total number of meetings held by all standing committees of the Board on which he or she served during fiscal year 2023.    ​

 Director Independence    ​

 Eight of the nine director nominees are independent directors as defined in accordance with the listing standards of the NYSE. These standards provide that a director is independent only if our Board affirmatively determines that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship with the Company. They also specify various relationships that preclude a determination of director independence. Material relationships may include commercial, industrial, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable, family and other business, professional and personal relationships.    Applying these standards, our Board, upon the recommendation of our Nominating Committee, annually reviews the independence of our directors. In its most recent review, our Board considered, among other things, the employment relationships between the Company and our directors and their families; the other specific relationships that would preclude a determination of independence under the NYSE independence rules; any affiliation of the Company’s directors and their families with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, compensation consultants, legal counsel and other consultants and advisors; any transactions with directors and members of their families that would require disclosure in this Proxy Statement under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules regarding related party transactions; and the amount of our contributions to non-profit organizations of which some of our directors or members of their families are associated.    The Board determined that the following director nominees are independent as determined by the standards of the NYSE: Bradley W. Buss, Lydia H. Kennard, Derek J. Kerr, Kristy Pipes, Douglas W. Stotlar, Daniel R. Tishman, Sander van ’t Noordende and General Janet C. Wolfenbarger.    ​

 Board Leadership Structure    ​

 The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate consistent with our commitment to best-in-class governance. This leadership structure gives primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company to our Chief Executive Officer, while the Chairman of the Board facilitates our Board’s independent oversight of management and promotes communication between management and our Board.    The Board has been, and continues to be, a proponent of Board independence. The Company’s corporate governance structures and practices provide for a strong, independent Board and include several independent oversight mechanisms, including only independent directors serving as committee chairs and the directors’ and committees’ ability to engage independent consultants and advisors. The Audit, Compensation and Nominating Committees are composed entirely of independent directors.    ​

 Executive Sessions    ​

 Executive sessions of non-employee directors are included on the agenda for every regularly scheduled Board and committee meeting and, during fiscal year 2023, executive sessions were held at each regularly scheduled Board and committee meeting. Executive sessions are chaired by the Chairman during Board meetings, and by the respective Committee Chair during committee meetings.

 Board’s Role in Risk Oversight    ​

 The Board plays an active role, both as a whole and at the committee level, in overseeing management of the Company’s risks. Management is responsible for the Company’s day-to-day risk management activities. The Company relies on a comprehensive risk management process to aggregate, monitor, measure and manage risks. The risk management process is designed to enable the Board to establish a mutual understanding with management of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management practices and capabilities, to review the Company’s risk exposure and to elevate certain key risks for discussion at the Board level. The full Board monitors risk through regular reports from each of the committee chairs and is apprised of particular risk management matters in connection with its general oversight and approval of corporate matters, as disclosed in the below chart:   
 We believe the division of risk management responsibilities described above provides an effective framework for evaluating and addressing the risks facing the Company, and that our Board leadership structure supports this approach because it allows our independent directors, through the independent committee chairs, to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management.    ​

 Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices    ​

 In fiscal year 2023, the Compensation Committee’s independent consultant, Exequity LLP, conducted a risk assessment of the Company’s compensation policies and practices as they apply to all employees, including executive officers. Exequity LLP reviewed the design features and performance metrics of our cash and stock-based incentive programs, along with the approval mechanisms associated with each, to determine whether any of these policies and practices could create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 As part of the review, several factors were noted that reduce the likelihood of excessive risk-taking:    •
  Our compensation mix is balanced among fixed components such as salary and benefits, annual incentive payments and long-term incentives, including Performance Earning Program (“PEP”) awards and restricted stock units (“RSU”) granted under our stockholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan, which typically vest or are earned over three years.   ​

        

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
         •
  The Compensation Committee has ultimate authority to determine, and reduce, if appropriate and consistent with applicable arrangements, compensation provided to our executive officers, including each of the NEOs. 
​
  •
  The Compensation Committee, under its charter, has the authority to retain any advisor it deems necessary to fulfil its obligations and has engaged Exequity LLP as its independent consultant. Exequity performs services for the Compensation Committee as described in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this Proxy Statement.   ​
  •
  Our annual incentive programs for employees are funded in the aggregate based on the results of key financial metrics. Individual payouts are based on a combination of financial metrics as well as qualitative factors.   ​
  •
  Our long-term equity incentive awards, including PEP awards and restricted stock units granted under our stockholder-approved 2020 Stock Incentive Plan, are all approved by either the Compensation Committee for our executive officers or by our Chief Executive Officer for nonexecutive officers.   ​
  •
  Our NEOs are subject to stock ownership guidelines, our insider trading policy and our updated clawback policy.   ​
  Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that its compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.    ​

 Committees of the Board of Directors    ​

 The Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating Committee. In accordance with NYSE regulations, each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating Committee has been determined by our Board to be “independent.” The committees operate under written charters that are available for viewing on the “Corporate Governance” area of the “Investors” section of our website at www.aecom.com. The members of each of the standing committees at the time of this filing are as follows:    Audit Committee    Kristy Pipes, Chair
Bradley W. Buss Derek J. Kerr Douglas W. Stotlar General Janet C. Wolfenbarger
 Compensation and Organization Committee    Daniel R. Tishman, Chair
Bradley W. Buss Douglas W. Stotlar Sander van ’t Noordende
 Nominating and Governance Committee    Bradley W. Buss, Chair
Lydia H. Kennard Daniel R. Tishman Sander van ’t Noordende General Janet C. Wolfenbarger
 Audit Committee.   The Audit Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors as defined under Rule 10A-3(b)(1) of the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the regulations of the NYSE, appoints the Company’s independent auditors, reviews the results and scope of the audit of our financial statements as well as other services provided by our independent auditors, reviews and approves audit fees and all non-audit services as well as reviews and evaluates our audit and control functions, including our internal audit function. Our Board has determined that Ms. Pipes, Chair of the Audit Committee, qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined by the rules under the Exchange Act. The “Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors” is included in this Proxy Statement. Our Audit Committee held four meetings during fiscal year 2023. 
        

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
         Compensation and Organization Committee.   The Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors as defined under the regulations of the NYSE, oversees our compensation plans. Such oversight includes decisions regarding executive management salaries, incentive compensation and long-term compensation plans, as well as Companywide equity plans for our employees. Grants of equity awards by the Compensation Committee under our compensation plans are approved solely by directors who are “Non-Employee Directors” within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. This committee also reviews the Board’s compensation plan for non-employee directors and determines whether independent compensation consultants should be utilized. For further information regarding the Compensation Committee’s processes and procedures for determining executive and nonemployee director compensation, see the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” section of this Proxy Statement. The “Report of the Compensation and Organization Committee of the Board of Directors” is included in this Proxy Statement. Our Compensation Committee held three meetings during fiscal year 2023. 
 Nominating and Governance Committee.   The Nominating Committee is composed solely of independent directors as defined under the regulations of the NYSE and is responsible for recruiting and retaining qualified persons to serve on our Board, including recommending such individuals to the Board for nomination for election as directors; for evaluating director independence; and for oversight of our compliance activities. The Nominating Committee also considers written suggestions from stockholders, including potential nominees for election, and oversees other governance programs such as the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. This committee also conducts performance evaluations for directors being elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, and engages in succession planning for the Board and key leadership roles on the Board and its committees. Our Nominating Committee held four meetings during fiscal year 2023. 
 ​

 Corporate Governance Guidelines    ​

 Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which set forth several important principles regarding our Board and its committees, including Board of Director membership criteria as well as other matters. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available for viewing on the “Corporate Governance” area of the “Investors” section of our website at www.aecom.com.    ​

 Codes of Conduct and Ethics    ​

 We have adopted a Code of Conduct that describes the professional, legal, ethical, financial and social responsibilities of all of our directors, officers and employees. We require all of our directors, officers and employees to read and acknowledge the Code of Conduct, and we provide regular compliance. Our directors, officers and employees are also encouraged to report suspected violations of the Code of Conduct through various means, including a toll-free hotline available 24 hours, 7 days a week in multiple languages, and they may do so anonymously. We do not tolerate acts of retaliation against anyone who makes an honest and sincere report of a possible violation of law or of our Code of Conduct or policies, or who participates in an investigation of possible wrongdoing. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect those who report misconduct, and we enforce any applicable protections afforded by such laws.    We also obtain year end affirmations from management personnel confirming compliance with the Code of Conduct. If we make substantive amendments to the Code of Conduct or grant any waiver, including any implicit waiver, to our principal executive, financial or accounting officer or persons performing similar functions or any director, we will disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver in accordance with applicable rules and regulations. In addition, we have a separate Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that specifies the required standards of conduct for employees with financial reporting responsibilities. We also have an Anticorruption Policy that provides specific guidance to help ensure that lawful and ethical business practices are followed while our employees conduct business anywhere in the world. Our various policies are available for viewing on the “Ethics and Compliance” section of our website at www.aecom.com and in print to any stockholder that requests it. Any such request should be addressed to AECOM, 13355 Noel Road, Suite 400, Dallas, Texas 75240, Attention: Corporate Secretary.

         ​

 Communications with the Board of Directors    ​

 Our stockholders or other interested parties may communicate with our Board, a committee of our Board or one or more directors by sending a letter addressed to the Board, a committee of our Board or one or more directors to AECOM, 13355 Noel Road, Suite 400, Dallas, Texas 75240, Attention: Corporate Secretary. All communications will be compiled by our Corporate Secretary and forwarded to the Board, the committee or the director, as appropriate.    ​

 Director Nominations, Board Refresh and Succession Planning    ​

 The Nominating Committee is charged with identifying, reviewing and recommending to the Board qualified individuals to become directors and regularly assessing the size and composition of the Board and recommending any changes to the Board. The Nominating Committee also engages in succession planning for the Board and key leadership roles on the Board and its committees.    The Nominating Committee reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the current composition of the Board, the operating requirements of the Company and the long-term interests of the Company’s stockholders. In conducting this assessment, the Nominating Committee considersdiversity, skills and such other factors as it deems appropriate to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capabilities. This periodic assessment enables the Board to update the skills and experience it seeks in the Board, as a whole and in individual directors, as the Company’s needs evolve over time and to assess the effectiveness of efforts at pursuing diversity. From time to time, while identifying director candidates, the Nominating Committee may establish specific skills and experience that it believes the Company should seek to constitute a balanced and effective Board.   
 It is our belief that members of the Board should have the highest professional and personal ethics and values. We believe that the Board should be comprised of individuals who are committed to enhancing stockholder value with sufficient time to effectively carry out their duties. While all directors should possess business acumen, the Board endeavors to include an array of targeted skills and experience in its overall composition. Criteria that the Nominating Committee looks for in director candidates include business experience and skills, judgment, integrity, an understanding of such areas as finance, marketing, regulation, end markets and public policy and the absence of potential conflicts with the Company’s interests. In particular, the Nominating Committee seeks candidates that have the following key skills and experience, each of which it is views as particularly important:    •
  senior leadership experience;   ​
  •
  industry experience;   ​
  •
  public company experience;   ​
  •
  financial expertise;   ​
  •
  government/regulatory expertise; and   ​
  •
  international expertise.   ​
  The Nominating Committee believes that it is essential that Board members represent diverse viewpoints and backgrounds. In identifying and selecting individuals, the Board and the Nominating Committee consider diversity, age, gender, skills, and such other factors as they deem appropriate to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability. In addition, the Nominating Committee believes the Board should encompass individuals with diverse backgrounds and perspectives and representation of individuals from underrepresented communities. Diversity is an important consideration in the director nomination process because the Board believes that people of different 
        

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
         genders, experiences, ages, races and ethnic backgrounds can contribute different, useful perspectives, while collaborating effectively to further the Company’s objectives.    Our Nominating Committee will consider stockholder nominations for directors. The Nominating Committee evaluates any such nominees that are properly submitted using the same criteria it otherwise employs, as described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.Any recommendation submitted by a stockholder must include the same information concerning the potential candidate as is required when a stockholder wishes to nominate a candidate directly. In addition, any such recommendation must be received in the same time frame as is required by our Bylaws when a stockholder wishes to nominate a candidate directly. To be timely, the notice must be received by the close of business no fewer than 90 and no more than 120 days prior to the date of the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting of stockholders. However, in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to such anniversary date or delayed more than 30 days after such anniversary date, or no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received no more than 120 days prior to the date of the annual meeting and not less than the later of the close of business (a) 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting and (b) on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting was first made by the Company. In no event shall an adjournment, recess or postponement of any annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder notice.    To be in proper form, the notice must, as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, set forth all information concerning such person as would be required in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and all written and signed representations and all completed and signed questionnaires required pursuant to our Bylaws. In addition, as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, the notice must also state the name and address, as they appear on the Company’s books, of such stockholder and such beneficial owner and the class or series and number of shares of the Company that are owned of record and beneficially by such stockholder and such beneficial owner.    As to the stockholder giving the notice, or if the notice is on behalf of a beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is being made, as to such beneficial owner, and if such beneficial owner is an entity, as to each control person of such entity, the notice must state the class or series and number of shares of the Company that are owned of record and beneficially by such stockholder or beneficial owner and by any control person, a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination between such stockholder or beneficial owner and any other person and by any control person, including, without limitation, any agreements that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 5 or Item 6 of Schedule 13D (regardless of whether the requirement to file a Schedule 13D is applicable) of the Exchange Act, and a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including, without limitation, any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholder’s notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder, beneficial owner or control person, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class or series of the Company’s capital stock, or maintain, increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder, beneficial owner or control person with respect to shares of stock of the Company. Stockholders who wish to nominate candidates for director must do so pursuant to these procedures.    In order to encourage Board refreshment and facilitate succession planning, in November 2023 the Board updated its Corporate Governance Guidelines to establish a maximum twelve-year term of service requirement for new directors and a mandatory retirement age of 72 (75 for current directors).    ​

 Board Self-Assessment    ​

 The Nominating Committee facilitates an annual assessment of the performance of the Board and its committees and coordinates reports of the annual results to the full Board for discussions. The Nominating Committee also recommends changes to improve the Board and its committees. In 2023, the Nominating Committee engaged an outside law firm to obtain input from each director on the performance of the Board and its committees.

 Director Attendance at Annual Meetings    ​

 AECOM’s policy is for directors to attend our annual meetings of stockholders unless there are extenuating circumstances. Seven of our eight directors at the time of the meeting attended the 2023 Annual Meeting.    ​

 Director Compensation    ​

 Information regarding the compensation of our non-employee directors is discussed below in “Directors’ Compensation for Fiscal year 2023.”    ​

 Director Retirement Policy    ​

 Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that directors are required to retire from the Board at the end of the term of service during which they turn 72 years of age (or 75 for current directors).    ​

 Related Party Transaction Policy    ​

 We have adopted a written related party transaction policy, which covers transactions in excess of $120,000 between the Company and our directors, executive officers, 5% or greater stockholders and parties related to the foregoing, such as immediate family members and entities they control. The policy requires that any such transaction be considered and approved by our Audit Committee, except that if the transaction is less than $1 million, the Chair of the Audit Committee may approve such transaction. In reviewing such transactions, the policy requires the Audit Committee, or the Chair, as appropriate, to consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances available to the Audit Committee, including (if applicable) but not limited to the benefits to the Company, the availability of other sources for comparable products or services, the terms of the transaction and the terms available to unrelated third parties or employees generally. The Board has also determined that certain transactions are pre-approved and do not require review by the Audit Committee. These include (i) compensation of the executive officers and Board members, which is reviewed by the Compensation Committee, (ii) a transaction with another entity in which the interested director or executive officer has an indirect interest in the transaction solely as a result of being a director or less than 10% beneficial owner of such other entity, and (iii) transactions with another corporation or charitable organization if the director’s or executive officer’s only interest is as a director or as a non-executive officer employee of the other corporation or organization and the amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of the revenues of such other corporation or organization.    Under the policy, if we should discover related party transactions that have not been approved, the Audit Committee will be notified and will determine the appropriate action, including ratification, rescission or amendment of the transaction.

 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions    ​

 Mr. Tishman, a member of our Board, owns a substantial equity interest in, and has certain management rights with respect to a company unaffiliated with AECOM or its subsidiaries. That unaffiliated company associated with Mr. Tishman and a wholly owned subsidiary of AECOM are parties to an Occupancy Agreement (the “Occupancy Agreement”), dated July 14, 2010, pursuant to which the unaffiliated company associated with Mr. Tishman pays our wholly owned subsidiary a portion of the rent for office space in New York City in exchange for the right to use and occupy a portion of such space. In fiscal year 2023, our wholly owned subsidiary received approximately $613,611 in rent from the unaffiliated company associated with Mr. Tishman per the Occupancy Agreement. The Occupancy Agreement expired on January 1, 2023, at which point rent payments ceased. In addition, Mr. Tishman is an indirect owner of an unaffiliated real estate development project company that engaged a joint venture affiliated with an AECOM subsidiary for pre-construction and construction management services totaling $1,427,055. This project was substantially completed in 2023.    Mr. van ’t Noordende, a member of our Board and Compensation Committee, was appointed CEO of Randstad in March 2022. AECOM uses Randstad for temporary administrative staffing needs. In fiscal year 2023, AECOM paid Randstad approximately $173,585 for administrative staffing services.    ​

 Political Contributions and Lobbying    ​

 Our responsible participation in the U.S. political process is important to our success and the protection of stockholder value. Our Political Engagement Policy is available on the “Government Relations” area of the “About Us” section on our website at www.aecom.com. We update and publish our Political Engagement Policy annually, along with supporting exhibits detailing our political expenditures. That annual disclosure includes, but is not limited to, the following information:    •
  Federal, state and local lobbying expenditures;   ​
  •
  Amounts and recipients of any direct political contributions made by us in the United States (if any such expenditures are made);   ​
  •
  Amounts and recipients of any federal, state or local political contributions made by the AECOM PAC in the United States (if any such expenditures are made); and   ​

  In addition, we file quarterly a publicly available federal Lobbying Disclosure Act Report, providing information on activities associated with influencing legislation through communications with any Member of Congress, congressional staffer, or with any covered federal executive branch official. The report also provides disclosure on expenditures for the quarter, describes the specific pieces of federal legislation that were the topic of communications, and identifies the individuals who lobbied on behalf of AECOM. AECOM files similar periodic reports with state agencies where required reflecting state lobbying activities which are also publicly available.    ​

 Stock Ownership Guidelines for Non-Employee Directors    ​

 Nonemployee directors are subject to stock ownership guidelines, which are intended to align their interests with those of our stockholders. Under the guidelines, our non-employee directors must maintain ownership of AECOM stock at a multiple of five times the annual retainer by the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the director’s initial appointment to the Board. The minimum number of shares guideline is updated annually based on the current cash retainer ($100,000) and the 12-month trailing average AECOM stock price. Shares owned directly or indirectly, the value of vested but unexercised stock options and unvested restricted stock are counted toward the guidelines. The table below outlines the ownership of our non-employee directors as of October 1, 2023. All current non-employee directors already meet or are expected to meet guidelines within the five (5) year transition period.

  Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Outperformance    AECOM delivered strong year-over-year growth and achieved or exceeded its initial and increased financial guidance on every key financial metric:   
 Note: guidance presented based on the mid-point of respective ranges where available.    *
  See Annex A, Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items.   ​
  •
  Organic Net Service Revenue (“NSR”) Growth accelerated to 8% for the full year, including 9% growth in the design business.   ​
  •
  Segment Adjusted Operating Margin increased by 60 basis points to 14.7%, which exceeded our guidance and set a new full year record.   ​
  •
  Adjusted EBITDA increased by 10% over the prior year on a constant-currency basis, to $964 million, which marked a new high and exceeded the mid-point of both our original and increased guidance.   ​
  •
  Adjusted Earnings per Share (“EPS”) increased by 12% over the prior year on a constant-currency basis, to $3.71, which exceeded the mid-point of both our original and increased guidance.   ​
  •
  Free Cash Flow of $591 million for the full year exceeded the mid-point of our guidance and marked the ninth consecutive year of free cash flow within or above the mid-point of our guidance range.   ​
  •
  Record Project Pursuit Win Rate, Full Year Wins and Pipeline of Opportunities contributed to 15% contracted backlog growth in the design business on a constant-currency basis; total backlog in the design business increased by 13% and was at a record high level.   ​
  •
  Strong Balance Sheet and Financial Performance supported approximately $475 million of capital allocated to stockholders through share repurchases and dividends in fiscal year 2023, while net leverage remained low at 0.9x and approximately 80% of our debt is fixed, swapped to fixed, or capped at substantially lower rates over the next several years. The Company also has no bond maturities until 2027.   ​
  As a result of our strong execution on our short and long-term strategic and financial commitments, AECOM’s TSR has consistently outperformed major market indices and its industry competitors. Specifically, AECOM’s total stockholder return over the past three fiscal years is 101%, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices by 73 and 83 percentage points, respectively. This outperformance demonstrates that our executive pay design is contributing to long-term stockholder value creation and that pay is well-aligned with the Company’s performance.

​
   The Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, has been authorized to determine and approve compensation for AECOM’s executive officers. As part of the annual compensation planning process for NEOs, the Compensation Committee reviews their base salary, short-term and long-term incentive compensation, with a focus on the total reward package. As further described below, the Compensation Committee looks to a peer group of companies, as well as the broader market, as a baseline for compensation decisions for NEOs. However, AECOM does not target executive officer compensation at a specific level or percentage relative to compensation provided by the companies in the compensation peer group or broader market. Instead, when determining compensation for executive officers, the Compensation Committee takes into account a broad array of factors, including the experience level of the individuals in their current positions, the overall financial and strategic performance of the Company during the year and the performance and contribution of each executive during the year relative to individual, predefined goals and objectives. Differences in compensation levels for our NEOs are 
        

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
         driven by the Compensation Committee’s assessment, in its judgment, of each of our executive’s responsibilities, experience and compensation levels for similar positions at peer companies. Except as otherwise noted in this Compensation Discussion & Analysis, the Compensation Committee’s determinations are subjective and the result of business judgment informed by members’ experiences, analysis of peer company data, input from the independent consultant, and overall compensation trends.   
​ | ​ | Role of the Compensation Committee | ​ | ​
--+---+------------------------------------+---+--

 ​
  –
  Reviews the Company’s financial, strategic and operational metrics and goals, compensation peer group and approves the performance objectives of the CEO and other executive officers.   ​
  –
  Approves design changes to the executive compensation program, as applicable.   ​
  –
  Reviews full year Company financial and strategic performance to understand accomplishments relative to established objectives.   ​
  –
  Evaluates the CEO’s performance in light of the review of Company performance.   ​
  –
  Discusses with the CEO his evaluation of the performance of each of the other executive officers relative to their individual performance objectives.   ​
  –
  Determines compensation amounts for the CEO and each of the other executive officers, taking into account: 
​
  •
  Prior year’s compensation;   ​
  •
  Performance assessments;   ​
  •
  Market considerations;   ​
  •
  Individual performance and retention considerations;   ​
  •
  Input from the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant; and   ​
  •
  For the other NEOs, the CEO’s recommendations.   ​
  –
  Reviews and approves the grants and payouts of long-term incentive equity awards, including certification of the financial results that support awards made under the annual and long-term incentive programs.   ​
  With respect to individual long-term incentive equity awards, the Compensation Committee considers individual performance, market data, including compensation for comparable positions at peer companies, and the strategic importance of the NEO’s position to determine a dollar denominated long-term incentive equity value to be awarded to each NEO. The dollar value awarded by the Compensation Committee to each NEO is then converted into a specific number of units, based on the fair market value of AECOM common stock on the date of grant.    Compensation and Organization Committee’s Independent Compensation Consultant    The Compensation Committee has the authority to retain the services of outside consultants to assist it in performing its responsibilities. The Compensation Committee engaged the services of the consulting firm Exequity LLP. During fiscal year 2023, the consultant provided data on the compensation and relative performance of compensation peer group companies as well as general industry data to the Compensation Committee, made presentations on regulatory and legislative matters affecting executive compensation, provided advice on the degree to which compensation arrangements are consistent with market practices, and consulted on other executive compensation matters as needed. Exequity LLP does not provide any services to the Company other than advising the Compensation Committee on executive and non-employee director compensation matters.    The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Exequity LLP, considering the following six factors and other factors that it deemed relevant: (1) other services provided to the Company by Exequity LLP, (2) the amount of fees paid by the Company to Exequity LLP as a percentage of Exequity LLP’s total revenue, (3) the policies or procedures maintained by Exequity LLP that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest, (4) any business or personal relationships between the individual employees of Exequity LLP involved in the engagement and a member of the Compensation Committee, (5) any AECOM stock owned by Exequity LLP’s employees involved in the engagement and (6) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and Exequity LLP or the employees of Exequity LLP involved in the engagement. Following such assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that Exequity LLP is independent and that Exequity LLP’s work raises no conflicts of interest.            

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
         Assessing Competitive Practice    As part of its due diligence when making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee examines pay data for a group of comparable companies to stay current with market pay practices and trends and to understand the competitiveness of the Company’s total compensation and its components of pay. The Compensation Committee uses the compensation peer group and market survey data for informational purposes. The Company does not target a specific percentile or make significant pay decisions based on market data alone. The Compensation Committee considers Company performance as well as the level of responsibility, experience and tenure of the individual and performance in the role.    Fiscal Year 2023 Compensation Peer Group    In connection with the ongoing transformation of the Company into a Professional Services business, the Compensation Committee refreshed the Company’s compensation peer group (the “Compensation Peer Group”) in 2022 to align with the Company’s strategic profile by identifying the Company’s competitors for talent and taking into consideration other various measures of size, scope, and complexity, with a focus on revenue, enterprise value, and net service revenue. The 2023 peer group was unchanged.

  Stockholder Engagement and Responsiveness    We continue to engage our stockholders on an on-going basis to solicit feedback on all matters including our executive pay program. In fiscal year 2023, we directly engaged with stockholders who collectively own greater than 50% of our outstanding shares. Stockholders affirmed their support for the Company’s compensation philosophy, chosen metrics, and resulting pay-for-performance alignment, as evidenced by last year’s high level of support for the Company’s directors and executive compensation program, and continued to emphasize an expectation for best-in-class ESG disclosure, governance, and pay for performance alignment.

  For fiscal year 2023, the Compensation Committee approved performance measures for our NEOs as set forth in the table below to support our strategy for attaining long-term profitable growth and stockholder value creation. The targets for each of the financial metrics align with the earnings guidance provided to our stockholders and our financial plan. 
        

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
        
​ | Metric | ​ | ​ | ​ | Why Selected | ​
--+----------------------------------------------+---+---+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--
​ | Free Cash Flow | ​ | ​ | ​ | Free cash flow both measures and incentivizes allocation of capital in a disciplined manner to high-return investments and encourages working capital conversion. Free cash flow is also critical to our capital allocation policy, which is to return substantially all available cash flow to stockholders, and contributes to ROIC, another key metric. Because free cash flow is a key metric for our investors and is included in our financial guidance, we selected it as a performance measure in fiscal 2023 to replace operating cash flow. | ​
​ | Adjusted EBITDA | ​ | ​ | ​ | Adjusted EBITDA incentivizes achievement of the our annual financial plan, which includes delivering high-value organic revenue growth, margin expansion, and disciplined investments in growth initiatives, employee development programs, and innovation. | ​
​ | NSR Segment Adjusted Operating Margin % | ​ | ​ | ​ | NSR Segment Adjusted Operating Margin% focuses on underlying operational performance, including executing our strategy, which emphasizes profitable growth, and investing through our margins to deliver for today and deliver more in the future. | ​
​ | Key Performance Indicator (“KPI”) Assessment | ​ | ​ | ​ | KPI Assessment encourages focus on the achievement of the Company’s non-financial strategic objectives including sustainability and ESG goals. These KPIs are developed for each NEO and, in the instance of our CEO, include such non-financial strategic objectives as: • Total recordable incident rate of no greater than 0.11, which would continue to lead the industry ​ • Percentage of women in leadership of greater than 20%, consistent with the Company’s near-term targets included in its Sustainable Legacies strategy ​ • Voluntary attrition of high-performers of less than 10%, which would exceed benchmark levels ​ • Employee satisfaction as reflected by the percentage of employees that would recommend AECOM as a great place to work as indicated in the Company’s bi-annual all-employee survey of at least 70%, which would continue to significantly exceed industry benchmark levels ​ | ​

  ​

 Long-Term Incentives    ​

 Long-term incentive equity awards reward the creation of long-term stockholder value and achievement of key metrics over a longer-term period, aligning our NEOs’ interests with those of our stockholders by linking the value of our NEOs’ compensation to AECOM’s stock price. The PEP awards are subject to performance metrics that drive the successful execution of our long-term strategy to build sustainable profitable growth and stockholder value, and both the PEP awards and RSU awards serve as a retention tool for our NEOs with 3-year continued service vesting requirements.    Long-Term Equity Incentive Award    As part of its review of fiscal year 2023 performance, the Compensation Committee analyzed the role and responsibilities of each NEO, including their past and current performance history, and prevailing market practices with respect to our Compensation Peer Group and across industries. Based on these factors (as well as taking into consideration the Compensation Committee’s collective experience regarding appropriate annual equity grant levels), the Compensation Committee approved the following equity awards in fiscal year 2023:

2023 Achievements and Payouts
 ​

 Fiscal Year 2021 (PEP21)    ​

 PEP21 has a three-year performance period to measure ROIC and Relative TSR, and a 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year performance period to measure average Adjusted EPS Growth. The table below details the final performance results. 

​ | Fiscal Years 2021 – 2023 | ​ | ​ | ​ | Threshold (0% Payout) | ​ | ​ | ​ | Target (100% Payout) | ​ | ​ | ​ | Maximum (200% Payout) | ​ | ​ | ​ | Actual | ​ | ​ | ​ | Actual Payout (%) | ​

​ | Relative TSR | ​ | ​ | ​ | 25th percentile | ​ | ​ | ​ | 55th percentile | ​ | ​ | ​ | 75th percentile | ​ | ​ | ​ | 57th percentile | ​ | ​ | ​ | 110.7% | ​
​ | Adjusted EPS Growth | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | 1-Year | ​ | ​ | ​ | 14.2% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 17.8% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 21.3% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 22.0% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 200.0% | ​
​ | 2-Year | ​ | ​ | ​ | 9.7% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 12.1% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 14.5% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 19.2% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 200.0% | ​
​ | 3-Year | ​ | ​ | ​ | 8.0% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 10.0% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 12.0% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 12.4% | ​ | ​ | ​ | 200.0% | ​

  Prior to approving the PEP21 payout, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company’s stock price performance and Relative TSR as compared to the peer group during the PEP21 performance period to confirm alignment between pay and performance. The Compensation Committee determined that the Company’s stock price performance supported the PEP21 payout as the Company’s market capitalization increased by approximately $4.7 billion or 71% over the performance period. Importantly, as shown below, the Company’s stock also outperformed the broader stock market, as represented by the S&P 500 index, over that time period by nearly 50%.   
 The Committee also determined the Company’s Relative Total Stockholder Return during the PEP21 performance period of 52.6% compared to our ISS peer group and 57.1% compared to our fiscal year 2021 proxy peer group supported the PEP21 payout.    ​

 Fiscal Years 2022 (PEP22) and 2023 (PEP23)    ​

 PEP22 and PEP23 have three-year performance periods to measure ROIC and Relative TSR, and a 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year performance period to measure average Adjusted EPS Growth.    The Compensation Committee sets performance targets that it believes to be rigorous and challenging. Because pre-established targets for financial metrics are competitively sensitive, they are not disclosed here. However, all 
         45

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
         targets align with the Company’s long-term plan and/or guidance to stockholders and are designed to drive performance that further enhances long-term stockholder value creation.    For both PEP22 and PEP23, the Relative TSR goals are as follows:   
​ | Metric | ​ | ​ | ​ | Threshold (0% Payout) | ​ | ​ | ​ | Target (100% Payout) | ​ | ​ | ​ | Maximum (200% Payout) | ​
--+--------------+---+---+---+--------------------------------------------------------+---+---+---+-------------------------------------------------------+---+---+---+--------------------------------------------------------+--
​ | Relative TSR | ​ | ​ | ​ | 25th percentile | ​ | ​ | ​ | 55th percentile | ​ | ​ | ​ | 75th percentile | ​

  100% target payout for Relative TSR requires outperformance against the current Compensation Peer Group at the end of the performance period at the 55th percentile. There is no payout below the 25th percentile and Relative TSR of 75th percentile or higher would result in a 200% payout. Linear interpolation is applied for outcomes between those shown in the illustration above.

         Other Programs, Policies and Guidelines    ​

 Stock Ownership Guidelines for Named Executive Officers    ​

 NEOs are subject to stock ownership guidelines, which helps to ensure that their interests are aligned with those of stockholders. Under the guidelines, AECOM’s CEO is required to maintain ownership of AECOM stock at six times base salary and the other NEOs at three times base salary. The minimum number of shares required to meet the guideline is updated annually based on each executive’s salary and the 12-month trailing average AECOM stock price. Shares owned directly and indirectly, restricted stock units and vested stock options/shares are counted toward the guidelines. NEOs have five full fiscal years, starting from the date an executive is first subject to the guidelines, to comply.    The table below outlines the stock ownership of the NEOs as of October 1, 2023.   
​ | Named Executive Officers | ​ | ​ | ​ | Guideline — Salary Multiple | ​ | ​ | ​ | Actual — Salary Multiple | ​

 Benefit, Retirement and Perquisite Programs    ​

 To protect our executives’ health and well-being, facilitate the operation of the business, retain current executives and recruit new executives, AECOM’s NEOs are eligible to participate in benefit plans that are available to a substantial amount of all employees, including participation in retirement plans, medical insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, and time-off programs. Further, the Company offers certain additional benefits only to executive officers and other senior officers, where applicable, which consist of the following:    •
  Executive Annual Physical Program.   AECOM provides an annual complete executive physical examination benefit at no cost to each NEO.   ​
  •
  Executive Life Insurance.   AECOM provides company paid life insurance coverage as a multiple of base salary up to a maximum benefit of $2 million for each NEO.   ​
  •
  Executive Disability Program.   AECOM provides an Executive Disability Program, which offers salary replacement of up to 60% of base salary in the event of an executive’s disability (maximum $25,000 per month).   ​
  •
  AECOM Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.   A non-qualified deferred compensation plan that enables highly compensated U.S. employees to defer income tax on components of their compensation.   ​
  •
  Executive Relocation Policy.   AECOM provides relocation support to our most senior leadership. Executives draw from a budget to choose from a suite of relocation services.   ​
  •
  Perquisites.   The Company believes that offering certain limited perquisites facilitates the operation of AECOM’s business and assists in executive retention.   ​

 Clawback Provisions    ​

 In November 2023, the Board approved the Company’s updated clawback policy in compliance with Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act and NYSE Listing Standards. The clawback policy requires the Company to recover incentive-based compensation made to current and former executive officers that is granted, earned or vested based upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure in the event of an accounting restatement due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement under U.S. securities laws.    ​

 Hedging and Anti Pledging    ​

 The Company’s insider trading policy prohibits all directors, executive officers (as defined by Section 16 of the Exchange Act) and certain other employees designated as insiders from engaging in any hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero cost collars and forward sale contracts, involving Company securities.    In addition, the policy prohibits directors, executive officers and employees from buying shares on margin and the pledging of Company securities except in certain limited circumstances subject to Company approval and demonstration of the individual’s ability to repay the applicable loan without selling such securities.

  Includes any amounts deferred under our qualified defined contribution plan or our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. For more information regarding amounts deferred into the non-qualified deferred compensation plan, please refer to the “EXECUTIVE NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023” table. The fiscal year 2023, 2022, and 2021 compensation amounts are for a 52-week fiscal year.   ​
  (2)
  These amounts represent the grant date fair value of the stock awards granted during the applicable fiscal year, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 as described below and in the “Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal Year 2023” table. 
​
  The grant date fair value amounts in this column for fiscal year 2023 are based on the following calculations:    •
  The grant date fair value of PEP awards subject to financial performance vesting conditions is calculated based upon the number of target PEP units granted multiplied by 66.7% and by the common stock price of $83.67 on the day of grant for the awards issued on December 15, 2022. The grant date fair value of PEP awards subject to relative TSR market conditions is calculated based upon the number of target PEP units granted multiplied by 33.3% and by the Monte Carlo value of $116.60 on December 15, 2022.   ​
  •
  The annual RSU awards granted on December 15, 2022 are calculated based upon the number of RSUs granted multiplied by the closing common stock price of $83.67 on the grant date.   ​
  With respect to the PEP awards, these amounts represent the value based on the target performance as of the grant date. As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, two thirds, or 66.7%, of the PEP2023 awards are subject to performance vesting conditions (ROIC and Adjusted EPS Growth) and one third, or 33.3%, are subject to a market condition (Relative TSR). The value of the financial metrics portion (66.7%) of the PEP2023 awards based on maximum performance is as follows: Mr. Rudd — $6,160,009 (55,217 PEP2023 units granted × 66.7% × $83.67 grant price × 200% maximum payout), Mr. Kapoor — $1,600,105 (14,343 PEP2023 units granted × 66.7% × $83.67 grant price × 200% maximum payout), Ms. Poloni — $1,680,094 (15,060 PEP2023 units granted × 66.7% × $83.67 grant price × 200% maximum payout), Mr. Gan — $1,000,024 (8,964 PEP2023 units granted × 66.7% × $83.67 grant price × 200% maximum payout), and Mr. Battley — $720,008 (6,454 PEP2023 units granted × 66.7% × $83.67 grant price × 200% maximum payout). PEP2023 awards cliff vest after a three-year performance period on December 15, 2025 based on cumulative performance against performance goals and continued employment over that period (except in the case of certain qualifying terminations). RSU awards cliff vest on the third anniversary of the grant date (December 15, 2025), subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date (except in the case of certain qualifying terminations).    The “Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal Year 2023,” “Outstanding Equity Awards for Fiscal Year End 2023” and the “Option Exercises and Stock Vested for Fiscal Year 2023” tables include additional information with respect to all awards outstanding as of September 30, 2023.

 Executive Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2023    ​

 The following table sets forth information with respect to activity in the AECOM Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (“EDCP”) during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The EDCP is a non-qualified plan that enables eligible employees to defer compensation in excess of amounts that may be contributed to the tax-qualified RSP. As with the RSP, participants are allowed to defer base salary into the EDCP. The EDCP also permits deferral of sign on bonuses and annual incentive bonuses. Up to 50% of base salary and 100% of any eligible bonus may be deferred into the EDCP. The EDCP offers a fixed rate of return, which is determined based on the September 30, 2022 Prime Rate.

  $27,048 of this amount was reported as an executive contribution or earnings above the Applicable Federal Rate in the “SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE” in prior year proxy statements. The information in this footnote is provided to clarify the extent to which amounts payable as deferred compensation represent compensation reported in our prior proxy statements, rather than new deferrals of compensation.   ​

 Payments and Benefits Upon Termination or Change in Control    ​

 Payments and benefits that would be provided to each NEO in addition to those received by all employees (such as payout of accrued salary and paid time off) as a result of certain termination events are set forth in the table below. The amounts shown assume a qualifying termination of employment effective as of the last day of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.    Agreements with NEOs    The Company has entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Rudd dated June 13, 2020 (the “Rudd Agreement”), pursuant to which he is eligible to participate in the Senior Leadership Severance Plan as described below, except that he is eligible to receive a severance multiple of two (2) times base salary (rather than one (1) times base salary). In addition, the Rudd Agreement provides that Mr. Rudd is eligible for the severance payments and benefits provided under the Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives, with the following modifications: (a) his lump sum cash severance benefit will equal two (2) times (rather than one (1) times) his annual base salary; and (b) his lump sum payment in respect of healthcare premiums will be multiplied by 24 (rather than 12).    On March 1, 2023, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Poloni (the “Poloni Agreement”). The employment is at-will and may be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without notice, by Ms. Poloni or the Company. The Poloni Agreement provides that Ms. Poloni is eligible for severance payments and benefits provided under the Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives and Senior Leadership Severance Plan.    In addition, the Company has an employment agreement with Mr. Battley dated January 1, 2021 (the “Battley Agreement”). In accordance with Australian law, the Battley Agreement provides for three (3) months’ notice of termination of employment by the Company, which the Company can elect to pay out in whole or in part in lieu of notice. The Company may terminate employment without notice or without payment in lieu of notice if the employee engages in conduct such as, but not limited, to serious misconduct, gross negligence, or breach of the agreement, each as determined by the Company.    Senior Leadership Severance Plan    In June 2020, the Compensation Committee approved the AECOM Senior Leadership Severance Plan (the “Severance Plan”). Each named executive officer currently employed by the Company is an eligible employee under the Severance Plan. The Severance Plan provides that, upon the termination of employment of an eligible employee by the Company other than for Cause (as defined in the Severance Plan) or due to death or disability (other than any such termination in connection with a change in control of the Company), in addition to the payment of accrued obligations, the eligible employee will receive the following compensation and benefits from the Company: (i) a lump 
        

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
         sum payment equal to one (1) times the eligible employee’s base salary (except with respect to Troy Rudd, whose multiple is two (2) times base salary); (ii) a prorated target bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination occurred based on the number of days of service in the fiscal year; (iii) additional service vesting credit for purposes of outstanding equity awards based on the eligible employee’s years of service with the Company (12 months of credit for five to ten years of service and 24 months of credit for more than ten years of service); and (iv) a lump sum payment in respect of the monthly employer portion of healthcare premiums multiplied by 12 (except with respect to Mr. Rudd, for whom the monthly employer portion of the premiums is multiplied by 24). The receipt of the foregoing severance payments and benefits will be subject to the eligible employee’s execution of a separation and release agreement that contains customary restrictive covenants, including obligations with respect to confidentiality and restrictions on soliciting the Company’s employees and customers.    Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives    Pursuant to the AECOM Technology Corporation Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives (the “CIC Plan”), the NEOs in the table below will receive the following benefits from the Company in connection with a Change in Control (as defined in the CIC Plan):    •
  Upon a Change in Control only (“single trigger”): (i) full vesting acceleration of equity awards only if the surviving entity does not continue or substitute such awards post-closing and (ii) deemed satisfaction of PEP Award targets based on actual performance through the change in control date and conversion of the earned PEPs to unvested RSUs that will continue to vest based on continued employment through the time based vesting period for the PEPs (generally through December 15 following the end of the PEP performance cycle).   ​
  •
  Upon a termination without Cause (as defined in the CIC Plan) or with Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Plan) within the period that begins 90 days prior to a Change in Control and ends 24 months following a Change in Control (“double trigger”): (i) full vesting acceleration of all unvested PEP (but based on actual performance through the change in control date), stock option, RSU and other equity awards; (ii) a lump sum cash severance payment equal to a multiple (two times for our CEO and 1.5 times for other NEOs) of the sum of the NEO’s base salary and average bonus earned over the three years prior to the year of termination (but including only those years in which the NEO was employed as a Key Executive of the Company); (iii) a pro rata annual bonus payment, under the annual incentive compensation plan applicable to the executive, for the year in which the employment termination occurs, based upon the number of full months between the beginning of the applicable annual performance period and the executive’s last date of employment and the target level of performance and payable when bonuses are otherwise payable to the Company’s executives; and (iv) continued health coverage for a number of years equal to the severance multiple (i.e., two years for our CEO and 1.5 years for other NEOs).   ​
  The receipt of the foregoing severance payments and benefits will be subject to the eligible employee’s execution of a general waiver and release of claims in a form provided by the Company (except as otherwise required by applicable law with respect to eligible employees employed outside of the United States).    Long-Term Incentive Equity Award Agreements    Pursuant to the terms of each of the RSU and PEP awards (“Long-term Incentive” in the tables below) held by our NEOs, upon the date of a termination of the executive’s employment as a result of death or disability, all unvested RSU awards will vest in full and PEP awards will vest based on actual performance as of the termination date. Upon a termination of the executive’s employment as a result of retirement, a pro rata portion of the unvested RSU2021, RSU2022, PEP2021, and PEP2022 awards will vest. The proration will be calculated as a percentage where the denominator is the number of months in the vesting period or performance cycle of the relevant award and the numerator is the number of whole months from the beginning date of the vesting period or performance cycle through the date of the executive’s termination. PEP awards will pay out after the end of the performance period at the lesser of actual performance or 100%. For awards granted in fiscal year 2023, RSU2023 awards will forfeit upon retirement and PEP2023 awards will continue to vest with payout after the end of the performance period at actual performance.

  Under the Change in Control Severance Policy in the event that any benefit payable constitutes a “parachute payment” within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 280G and would be subject to excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then payments shall be provided either in full or reduced to an amount in which no portion of the benefits would be subject to excise tax, whichever provides the greatest after-tax benefit to the executive. The amounts in the table represent the benefits without consideration of reduction to avoid excise tax and based on assumption of a double-trigger event.   ​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
         CEO Pay Ratio    Pay Ratio    Pursuant to Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the “Regulation,” below we provide disclosure of the ratio of our CEO’s annual total compensation to that of our median compensated employee.   
​ | ​ | | ​ | ​ | Total Compensation | ​ | ​ 
--+---+-----------------+---+---+--------------------+---+-----------
​ | ​ | CEO | ​ | ​ | ​ | $ | 11,459,952 | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | Median Employee | ​ | ​ | ​ | $ | 72,712 | ​ | ​ | ​
​ | ​ | Ratio | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | 157.6 | ​ | ​ | ​

  Global Employee Data Set    To derive our global employee data set, we employed the following methodology and assumptions:    •
  Data Source:   We used our global human resource system of record to aggregate employee information from our various systems worldwide.   ​
  •
  Determination Date:   Per the Regulation, registrants are allowed to identify a median employee every three years unless there has been a change in employee population or compensation arrangements that would significantly affect the pay ratio. For fiscal year 2023, we have used the same median employee as the prior fiscal year who was identified using September 17, 2022 as the determination date, which falls within the last three months of the prior fiscal year.   ​
  Consistently Applied Compensation Measure & Selection of Median Employee    To determine our median compensated employee, we used a Consistently Applied Compensation Measure (CACM). As our CACM, we used Annual Base Compensation, defined as base salary rate taking into account the employee’s full-time or part-time status and the employee’s scheduled hours of employment, plus any guaranteed 13th or 14th month period pay, as of the Determination Date. We exchanged non-U.S. compensation to U.S. dollars applying the same fixed annual exchange rate used in our filed periodic reports.    The SEC’s rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
         Strong Relationship Between CAP and Certain Performance Measures    •
  The Company’s CAP is well aligned with performance on key financial measures, including strong TSR that outperformed market indices and a 21% Adjusted EPS compounded growth rate, which reflects the Company’s focus on shareholder value creation. Despite this strong performance, as compared to fiscal 2021, CEO and non-CEO CAP declined by 7% and 1% respectively in fiscal 2023.   ​  •
  Additionally, performance on other key metrics that drive long-term value creation, including free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA and segment adjusted operating margin, also increased meaningfully over this period.   ​  •
  GAAP Net Income is influenced by a number of factors and can include items that are one-time in nature and is not exclusively used by investors to determine the long-term earnings power of the Company. As such, CAP and GAAP Net Income do not move in line with one another.   ​ 
 In the Company’s assessment, the following represents the most important financial performance measures used by the Company to link compensation actually paid to the Company’s NEOs for the most recently completed fiscal year to Company performance:

  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
         Report of the Audit Committee of the  Board of Directors    The Audit Committee is comprised of non-employee directors, all of whom are “independent” under the applicable listing standards of the NYSE and the applicable rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee is governed by a written charter, as amended and restated, which has been adopted by the Board. A copy of the current Audit Committee Charter is available for viewing on the “Corporate Governance” area of the “Investors” section of our website at www.aecom.com.    Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the consolidated financial statements, maintaining a system of internal controls and having appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for planning and carrying out an audit of the consolidated financial statements and an audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and expressing an opinion as to the consolidated financial statements’ conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and as to internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee monitors and oversees these processes and is responsible for selecting and overseeing the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.    As part of the oversight process, the Audit Committee met four times during fiscal year 2023. Throughout the year, the Audit Committee met with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, management and internal auditors, both together and separately in closed sessions, to review accounting, auditing, internal controls and financial reporting matters. In the course of fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee did, among other things, the following:    •
  reviewed and evaluated the performance and quality of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and its lead audit partner in its determination to recommend the retention of Ernst & Young LLP, including by assessing the performance of Ernst & Young LLP from within the Audit Committee and from the perspective of senior management and the internal auditor;   ​
  •
  considered whether the provision of non-audit services by Ernst & Young LLP to the Company is compatible with maintaining the registered public accounting firm’s independence;   ​
  •

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
         Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports    Our executive officers, directors and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of the outstanding shares of common stock are required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of our common stock. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require disclosure if an executive officer, director or 10% beneficial owner fails to file these reports on a timely basis. Based on a review of such reports and written representations from the reporting persons, the Company believes that all of these reports were timely filed during and with respect to fiscal year 2023, except that an amendment to Form 3 for Ms. Kennard was filed to disclose additional shares held in a trust that were not previously reported due to an administrative oversight.

Any proposal should be addressed to our Corporate Secretary and may be included in next year’s proxy materials only if such proposal complies with our Bylaws and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require us to include in our Proxy Statement or our proxy relating to any annual meeting any stockholder proposal that does not meet all of the requirements for inclusion established by the Securities and Exchange Commission.    In addition, the Company’s Bylaws require that the Company be given advance written notice of nominations for election to the Board and other matters that stockholders wish to present for action at an annual meeting of stockholders (other than matters included in the Company’s proxy materials in accordance with Rule 14a-8(e) under the Exchange Act).

         Annex A    ​

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items    ​

 Our proxy contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In particular, the Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures such as NSR segment operating margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS, free cash flow and net leverage, provide a meaningful perspective on its business results as the Company utilizes this information to evaluate and manage the business. We use adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS to exclude the impact of certain items, such as amortization expense and taxes to aid investors in better understanding our core performance results. We use free cash flow to present the cash generated from operations after capital expenditures to maintain our business. We present NSR to exclude pass-through subcontractor costs from revenue to provide investors with a better understanding of our operational performance. We present NSR segment operating margin to reflect segment operating performance of our Americas and International segments, excluding AECOM Capital and G&A. We also use constant-currency, which is calculated by conforming the current period results to the comparable period exchange rates, and net leverage, which is comprised of EBITDA as defined in the Company’s credit agreement dated October 17, 2014, as amended, and total debt on the Company’s financial statements, net of total cash and cash equivalents. Our non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
